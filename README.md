# Neuron AI - Examples
This repository contains several examples of how to use the Neuron AI framework to create fully featured AI Agents and RAG systems in PHP.

## Create an Agent

Neuron provides you with the Agent class you can extend to inherit the main features of the framework 
and create fully functional agents. This class automatically manages some advanced mechanisms for you such as memory,
tools and function calls, up to the RAG systems. You can go deeper into these aspects in the [documentation](https://docs.neuron-ai.dev).
In the meantime, let's create the first agent, extending the `NeuronAI\Agent` class:

```php
use NeuronAI\Agent;
use NeuronAI\SystemPrompt;
use NeuronAI\Providers\AIProviderInterface;
use NeuronAI\Providers\Anthropic\Anthropic;

class YouTubeAgent extends Agent
{
    public function provider(): AIProviderInterface
    {
        return new Anthropic(
            key: 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY',
            model: 'ANTHROPIC_MODEL',
        );
    }

    public function instructions(): string
    {
        return new SystemPrompt(
            background: ["You are an AI Agent specialized in writing YouTube video summaries."],
            steps: [
                "Get the url of a YouTube video, or ask the user to provide one.",
                "Use the tools you have available to retrieve the transcription of the video.",
                "Write the summary.",
            ],
            output: [
                "Write a summary in a paragraph without using lists. Use just fluent text.",
                "After the summary add a list of three sentences as the three most important take away from the video.",
            ]
        );
    }
}
```

The `SystemPrompt` class is designed to take your base instructions and build a consistent prompt for the underlying model
reducing the effort for prompt engineering.
